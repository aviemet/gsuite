# GSuite Signature Management Application

## Project Overview
A Firebase-based application for managing email signatures with support for multiple templates and views.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: TypeScript
- UI Components: React
- Data Fetching: TanStack Query
- Icons: @tabler/icons-react
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore)
- Authentication: Firebase Auth

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- SignaturesListPage: Main page for displaying signatures
  - Supports both grid and list view modes
  - View toggle implemented with Tabler icons

### Data Models

#### Templates
- Professional Template
- Simple Template
- Marketing Template

### Authentication
- Uses Firebase Auth Emulator for testing
- Test admin user: test@test.com
- Security rules require admin privileges for template management

### Development Tools

#### Test Data Seeding
Location: `packages/frontend/scripts/seed-firestore.ts`
Purpose: Seeds test templates into Firestore
Features:
- Proper Firebase app cleanup
- Authenticated admin user simulation
- Uses Firebase Auth Emulator

## Data Fetching Patterns
- TanStack Query implementation for data fetching
- Query client configuration and provider setup
- Templates query implementation

## Security
- Firestore security rules enforce admin authentication
- Test environment uses Firebase Auth Emulator
- No security rule weakening for testing - proper auth simulation used instead

## Test Data and Types

### Person Test Data
- Location: `packages/shared/src/person.testdata.ts`
- Exports a `Person` interface and a `samplePerson` object with fields for id, names, emails, phone numbers, job title, department, organization, and location.
