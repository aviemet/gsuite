# GSuite Signature Management Application

## Project Overview
A Firebase-based application for managing email signatures with support for multiple templates and views.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: TypeScript
- UI Components: React
- Data Fetching: TanStack Query
- Icons: @tabler/icons-react
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore)
- Authentication: Firebase Auth

## Project Structure
- The project utilizes a monorepo-like structure with a `packages` directory at the root.
- Key packages include:
    - `packages/frontend`: Contains the React frontend application.
    - `packages/shared`: Contains shared code/types/data used across different parts of the project.
    - `packages/functions`: Contains Firebase Cloud Functions (or similar backend logic).

## Architecture

### Frontend Folder Structure
- All page and feature-specific implementations are placed in the `features` folder, organized by feature or page.
- The `components` folder is reserved exclusively for highly reusable UI elements that are not specific to any single page or feature.
- Page entry points remain in the `pages` folder, delegating implementation to the appropriate feature modules.

### Frontend Components
- SignaturesListPage: Main page for displaying signatures
  - Supports both grid and list view modes
  - View toggle implemented with Tabler icons

### Data Models

#### Templates
- Professional Template
- Simple Template
- Marketing Template

### Authentication
- Uses Firebase Auth Emulator for testing
- Test admin user: test@test.com
- Security rules require admin privileges for template management

## Build and Configuration

### Vite
- The project uses Vite for frontend development and bundling.
- There are separate Vite configuration files:
    - `vite.config.ts` at the project root.
    - `packages/frontend/vite.config.ts` specific to the frontend package.
- **Path Aliases**: 
    - Aliases like `@/frontend`, `@/shared`, and `@/functions` are used to simplify import paths.
    - Root `vite.config.ts` defines these aliases pointing to `packages/frontend/src`, `packages/shared/src`, etc.
    - The `packages/frontend/vite.config.ts` also defines these aliases. It's crucial that its relative paths correctly point to the shared directories (e.g., `../../packages/shared/src` from `packages/frontend`). Misconfiguration here can lead to module resolution errors.
    - Always use the @/ prefixed alias for imports rather than relative import paths
- **CSS-in-JS**:
    - The frontend uses Linaria (`@wyw-in-js/vite`) for zero-runtime CSS-in-JS, as configured in `packages/frontend/vite.config.ts`. This plugin handles the transformation of CSS defined in TypeScript/JavaScript files.

### TypeScript
- A root `tsconfig.json`
