# GSuite Signature Manager Addon

## Project Overview
A Google GSuite addon designed to manage and automate email signatures across an organization. The addon leverages Google's APIs to interact with GSuite accounts and provides flexible signature management capabilities.

## Core Features

### Signature Template Management
- Store and manage multiple signature templates
- Support for dynamic data injection using template strings
- Templates can pull data from user and company accounts
- Conditional rendering based on:
  - User account data presence
  - Company account data presence
  - Custom JavaScript-like truthiness statements

### Deployment Options
- GSuite Group Policy Object (GPO) based deployment
- Scheduled deployment (e.g., daily updates)
- Manual deployment capabilities

## Technical Requirements
- Integration with Google GSuite APIs
- Secure storage of signature templates
- Efficient template processing engine
- Reliable scheduling system for automated deployments
- User-friendly interface for template management
- GSuite Addon Integration:
  - Google Developer Workspace configuration
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication setup
  - Addon manifest configuration
  - Proper scoping of API permissions
- Firebase Integration:
