# REQUIRED FOR EVERY INTERACTION:

1. Read .cursor/project.mdx at the start of each interaction
2. Before ending ANY response, if you've learned ANYTHING about:
   - Project structure
   - Code patterns
   - Implementation details
   - Conventions
   - Dependencies
   - Configuration
   You MUST update .cursor/project.mdx with this information
3. When updating .cursor/project.mdx:
   - Only add new information not already documented
   - Place information in the appropriate section
   - If no appropriate section exists, create one
   - Include specific details (versions, patterns, types) rather than general descriptions
4. After updating .cursor/project.mdx, explicitly note in your response what new information was added
